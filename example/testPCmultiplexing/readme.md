This is an example of Kurento Web SDK, doing a WebRTC loopback from your webcam
multiplexing to two pipelines, using a Kurento Media Server demo machine.

You can try it just by downloading the code and launching it from a static web
server, or try it from [JsFiddle](http://jsfiddle.net/gh/get/library/pure/kurento/kws-media-api/contents/example/WebRtcEndpoint_2).
